# base-debian-build
- **Basic toolkit for creating Debian packages using debuild. This makes it easier to avoid having to develop everything from scratch for each Debian package.**

# Notes

- `install`/`rules` must be customized → the templates cover a wide range of preconfigurations, but not everything fits
- configurations must be entered in `package.conf` → especially build and runtime dependencies
- the examples for `man` must be adapted to the programs.
